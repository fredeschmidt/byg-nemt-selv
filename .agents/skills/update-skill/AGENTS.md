# Update Skill

## Support Skill (Mandatory Order)

This skill applies skill-authoring constraints when editing skill docs.
Use it for `SKILL.md` and `AGENTS.md` updates.

## Execution Contract (Non-Negotiable)

- Read `SKILL.md` before taking any action.
- Read related skill files before editing.
- Recommend best placement before applying a rule change.
- Do not append blindly; integrate in the correct section.
- Remove duplication while preserving behavioral intent.

## Routing

- Use this skill for skill maintenance, cleanup, and rule placement decisions.
- Do not use this skill for normal product implementation (HTML, SCSS, JS, app logic).
